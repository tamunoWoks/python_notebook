## Strings and Text Editing
Text is one of the most common forms of data your programs will handle. Let’s look at some of the ways Python lets you write, print, and access strings in your code.

###  String Literals:
While string `values` are stored in the program’s memory, the string values that literally appear in our code are called `string literals`. Writing string literals in Python code seems straightforward: they begin and end with a single quotation mark, with the text of the string value in between. But how can you use quotes inside a string? Entering 'That is Alice's cat.' won’t work, because Python will think the string ends after Alice and will treat the rest (s cat.') as invalid Python code. Fortunately, there are multiple ways to write string literals.
