## for Loops and the range() Function
if you want to execute a block of code only a certain number of times? You can do this with a `for` loop statement and the
`range()` function.  

In code, a `for` statement looks something like for i in range(5): and includes the following:  
• The for keyword  
• A variable name  
• The in keyword  
• A call to the range() function with up to three integers passed to it  
• A colon  
• Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the for clause or for block)
