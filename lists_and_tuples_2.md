##  Short-Circuiting Boolean Operators
Boolean operators have a subtle behavior that is easy to miss. Recall that if either of the values combined by an `and` operator is `False`, the entire expression is `False`, and if either value combined by an `or` operator is `True`, the entire expression is `True`. If I presented you with the expression `False` and `spam`, it doesnâ€™t matter whether the `spam` variable is `True` or `False` because the entire expression would be `False` either way. The same goes for `True` or `spam`; this evaluates to `True` no matter the value of `spam`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python (and many other programming languages) use this fact to optimize the code so that it runs a little faster by not examining the right-hand side of the Boolean operator at all. This shortcut is called **short-circuiting**.  
Most of the time, your program will behave the same way it would have if Python checked the entire expression (albeit a few microseconds faster). However, let's consider this short program, where we check whether the first item in a list is 'cat':
