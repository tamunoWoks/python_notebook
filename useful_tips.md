## Useful Python Tips
- You can view the step-by-step execution of a program using the Python Tutor visualization tool at [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com). Click the forward button to move through each step of the program’s execution. You’ll be able to see how the variables’ values and the output change.
- **VARIABLE NAMES**  
  A good variable name describes the data it contains, and though you can name your variables almost anything, Python does have some naming restrictions. Your variable name must obey the following four rules:
    - It can’t have spaces.
    - It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
    - It can’t begin with a number.
    - It can’t be a Python keyword, such as if, for, return, or other keywords
you’ll learn in this book.
- **BOOLEAN VALUES**  
  The ***Boolean*** data type has only two values: **True** and **False**. (Boolean is capitalized because the data type is named after mathematician George Boole.)  
  Note that these Boolean values don’t have quotes, because they are different from the string values 'True' and 'False'.
- **THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE == AND = OPERATORS**  
  The `==` operator (equal to) has two equal signs, while the `=` operator (assignment) has just one equal sign.
    - The `==` operator asks whether two values are the same as each other.
    - The `=` operator puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.
