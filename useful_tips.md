## Useful Python Tips
- You can view the step-by-step execution of a program using the Python Tutor visualization tool at [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com). Click the forward button to move through each step of the program’s execution. You’ll be able to see how the variables’ values and the output change.
- **Variable names**
  A good variable name describes the data it contains, and though you can name your variables almost anything, Python does have some naming restrictions. Your variable name must obey the following four rules:
    - It can’t have spaces.
    - It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
    - It can’t begin with a number.
    - It can’t be a Python keyword, such as if, for, return, or other keywords
