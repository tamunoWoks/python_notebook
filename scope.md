## Local and Global Scopes
Only code within a called function can access the parameters and variables assigned in that function. These variables are said to exist in that functionâ€™s ***local scope***.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, code anywhere in a program can access variables
that are assigned outside all functions. These variables are said to exist in
the global scope.
