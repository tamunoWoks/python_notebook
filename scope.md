## Local and Global Scopes
Only code within a called function can access the parameters and variables assigned in that function. These variables are said to exist in that functionâ€™s ***local scope***.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, code anywhere in a program can access variables
that are assigned outside all functions. These variables are said to exist in
the ***global scope***.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variable that exists in a local scope is called a ***local variable***, while a variable that exists in a global scope is called a ***global variable***. A variable must be one or the other; it cannot be both local and global.
