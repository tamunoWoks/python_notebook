## The None Value
In Python, a value called `None` represents the absence of a value. The `None` value is the only value of the `NoneType` data type while other programming languages might call this value `null`, `nil`, or `undefined`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the Boolean `True` and `False` values, you must always write `None` with a capital *N*.
