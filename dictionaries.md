## The Dictionary Data Type
Like a list, a ***dictionary*** is a mutable collection of many values. But unlike indexes for lists, indexes for dictionaries can use many different data types, not just integers. These dictionary indexes are called ***keys***, and a key with its associated value is called a ***key-value pair***.  
In code, a dictionary is entered between curly brackets `{}`. For example:
```python
my_cat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'age': 17}
```
This assigns a dictionary to the `my_cat` variable. This dictionaryâ€™s keys are `'size'`, `'color'`, and `'age'`. The values for these keys are `'fat'`, `'gray'`, and `17`, respectively. You can access these values through their keys:
```python
my_cat['size'] # 'fat'

'My cat has ' + my_cat['color'] + ' fur.' # 'My cat has gray fur.'
```
