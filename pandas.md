# Pandas Library

Pandas is a powerful and widely-used open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions that make working with structured data fast, easy, and expressive. Pandas is particularly well-suited for working with tabular data, such as spreadsheets or SQL tables, and is a fundamental tool in the data science ecosystem.
