## Functions
A function is like a mini program within a program.  
Python provides several built-in functions, such as the print(), input(), and len() functions, but you can also write your own.

#### Creating Functions in Python:
In Python, functions are created using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The function body is written with indentation underneath the definition line.

##### Example:
This is a simple function with no parameters:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
greet()
```
