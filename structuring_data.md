## Using Data Structures to Model Real-World Things
Computers have good memories. A program on a modern computer can easily store billions of strings. Computers can even play chess without having a physical chessboard. They model data to represent a chessboard, and you can write code to work with this model to simulate a chess game.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where lists and dictionaries can come in handy. For example, we could come up with our own notation so that the Python dictionary {'h1': 'bK', 'c6': 'wQ', 'g2': 'bB', 'h5': 'bQ', 'e3': 'wK'} could represent a 
chessboard.
