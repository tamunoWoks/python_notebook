# Debugging
Debugging in programming is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code so that it runs correctly and produces the expected results.  

A bug can be anything that makes your program behave unexpectedly such as syntax mistakes, logic errors, or runtime crashes. Debugging is basically detective work: you trace through the code, test assumptions, and figure out why the program isn’t working as intended.

### Key steps in debugging:
1. **Identify the bug:**
    - Notice an error message, unexpected output, or crash.
    - Reproduce the problem consistently.
2. **Isolate the cause:**
    - Narrow down the part of the code causing the issue.
    - Use tools like print statements, breakpoints, or debuggers to track the program flow.
3. **Understand the error:**
    - Check what the code was supposed to do vs. what it’s actually doing.
    - Look for mistakes in logic, data types, conditions, or external dependencies.
4. **Fix the bug:**
    - Correct the faulty code or logic.
    - Ensure the fix doesn’t break other parts of the program.
5. **Test thoroughly:**
    - Run tests to confirm the bug is gone.
    - Check edge cases to ensure stability.
