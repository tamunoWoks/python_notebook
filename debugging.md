# Debugging
Debugging in programming is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code so that it runs correctly and produces the expected results.  

A bug can be anything that makes your program behave unexpectedly such as syntax mistakes, logic errors, or runtime crashes. Debugging is basically detective work: you trace through the code, test assumptions, and figure out why the program isnâ€™t working as intended.
