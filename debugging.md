# Debugging
Debugging in programming is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code so that it runs correctly and produces the expected results.  

A bug can be anything that makes your program behave unexpectedly such as syntax mistakes, logic errors, or runtime crashes. Debugging is basically detective work: you trace through the code, test assumptions, and figure out why the program isnâ€™t working as intended.

### Key steps in debugging:
1. **Identify the bug:**
    - Notice an error message, unexpected output, or crash.
    - Reproduce the problem consistently.
2. **Isolate the cause:**
    - Narrow down the part of the code causing the issue.
    - Use tools like print statements, breakpoints, or debuggers to track the program flow.
