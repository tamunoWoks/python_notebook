## Components of Flow Control
Flow control statements often start with a part called the condition and are always followed by a block of code called the clause. 

### Conditions:
Boolean expressions could all be considered conditions, which are the same thing as expressions; *condition* is just a more specific name in the context of flow control statements. A condition always evaluates to a Boolean value, True or False. A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False, and almost every flow control statement uses a condition. You’ll frequently write code that could be described in English as follows: “If this condition is true, do this thing, or else do this other thing.” Other code you’ll write is the same as saying, “Keep repeating these instructions as long as this condition continues to be true.”
